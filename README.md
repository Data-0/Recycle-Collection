This is a collection of more than 1 mod that i feel doesn't deserve their own page.

You'll find a bunch of mods that either let you craft something into another item, or recycle an item you already have for something else. You can choose to install either 1 or all the mods, or mix and match. Whatever you want. Some of the mods require items from Modders gear Toolbox, so make sure you have that incase you want them.  Thank you Jods!   Mod component is required as always.

BoneHook: Craft bones into hooks, levels fishing skill up.

FeltCloth: You can craft cat tail heads into cloth by taking the fibers out and spinning them back together, Would take hours irl,made it way shorter in the game for the sake of fun. Can be considered cheaty/dumb.

Improvised Cloth: Better Version imo. You use bark to make cordage, cordage into string, and string into cloth using the sewing kit. Makes more sense and is actually balanced, imo. Requires Modders Gear Toolbox for the new items. I would also suggest upping bark spawn chances if you choose to run this.

SteelBullets: Bulllets can now be crafted at a workbench, using 5 scrap and while having tools. Cheaty.

Bullet.Casings: Lets you craft casings from scrap.

WorkbenchGunpowder: Same ingredients as the normal recipe, will let you craft it at a normal workbench instead now.

HarderWetstones: You can craft whetstones at a crafting bench using Flint and Rocks, together with wood. Name comes from the fact i made a version before that was too easy. Thats also why this uses reclaimed wood instead of cedar/fir. Have fun beachcombing. 

ScrapFromSpray: At least they have a use now.

Flare.Gunpowder: Lets you craft gunpoweder from either blue or red flares.

FatToCookingOil: If you're near a lit fire, and you acces the fire crafting menu you can craft 1 fat into 1 cooking oil.
